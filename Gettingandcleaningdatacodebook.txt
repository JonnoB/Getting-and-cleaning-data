Code Book
=================


This code book is a modified version of the code book provided in the original documentation. 
The only differences are that the non relevant variables have been removed for ease of
understanding, and the variable names edited to reflect the names which are in the file.


The signals recorded were


tBodyAccXYZ
tGravityAccXYZ
tBodyAccJerkXYZ
tBodyGyroXYZ
tBodyGyroJerkXYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAccXYZ
fBodyAccJerkXYZ
fBodyGyroXYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag


The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 


mean: Mean value
std: Standard deviation


Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the variableAngle:


gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
